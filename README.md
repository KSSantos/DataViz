# PowerBI

This space is to share some of the data visualization tools in Power BI from courses that I've done and some dashboards that I try to create and play around in my free time.

# 1. Finance Dashboard

This dashboard was created based on a Power BI bootcamp from the Hashtag Treinamentos Youtube Channel. The purpose of the document was to extract information from a finance
database and prepare a dashboard for the Finance manager to see the total payments, income and profit from the last 12 months.
Note: The final file is in .pbix (Power BI) format.
